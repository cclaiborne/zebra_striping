### Zebra Striping

You have some tabular data of the form:

```
Heroes     | Weapon of Choice
------     | ----------------
Batman     | Utility Belt
Superman   | Laser Eyes
Spider-Man | Spidey Sense
Aquaman    | Trident
```

Using any technologies you would like, create a solution that will display this information in a zebra-striped (alternating hi-lighting) list of items.
